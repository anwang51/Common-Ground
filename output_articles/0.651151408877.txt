His Facebook profile photo, posted in May of 2012, shows him holding his daughter, who had recently turned 3 and was wearing a pink bow in her hair and a pink, frilly skirt. Wednesday, Fred Guttenberg posted on his Facebook page, asking for anyone who had spoken to his daughter to contact him. “Her passing was on, her shooting was on, her decision-making was on,” her mother, Lori Alhadeff, recalled. Meadow Pollack, 18, was a senior at the high school who was planning to go to Lynn University in Boca Raton, Fla. I found that strange, because Lenin was one of the most strong-willed men who ever lived; he was at once zealously one-sided and emotionally evasive, but nevertheless, throughout his exile, no matter where he happened to be, in Zurich, London or Paris, he made sure to have Turgenev’s collected works with him. He was short and stocky, with a stubbly beard, and there was something indomitable about him that made me think about an animal that won’t let go of something when it gets its teeth into it. When Robles returned one recent morning, he was a 20-year-old man — a husband and a budding baseball star. Standing there, he could vividly recall his mother raising two boys in 100 square feet, but life was different when he headed out the door. A couple months before he was eligible, Robles moved to an academy a few hours away, one that had the resources Manzanillo couldn’t provide, for his finishing touches. It’s in the same neighborhood he was raised, a short walk from the baseball field where he honed his craft as a preteen and a five-minute drive from the dark and dank 10-by-10 room.
