From their hilltop checkpoint, the soldiers who guard South Korea's border can see for miles across the Demilitarized Zone, to a small city in the distance on the north side. South Korea has long contended that Kijong-dong is a fa√ßade manned by the North Korean military. Now that the 2018 Winter Olympics are in full swing about 100 miles away, the mystery surrounding Kijong-dong serves as a metaphor for the North Korean athletes who have come to Pyeongchang. "When most people think of North Korea, we think of Kim Jong Un, rockets, missile launches," said Peter Kim, an American-born assistant professor at Kookmin University in Seoul. No one expected North Korea to participate in the Games, not until Kim Jong Un made conciliatory remarks toward South Korea in a New Year's Day speech. Though skeptics called it a ploy by Kim to appear statesmanlike and engaged with the international community, the arrival of the North Korean squad generated a worldwide buzz. As part of the Olympics deal, South Korea agreed to add 12 players from the North to its women's hockey team. The South Korean players said that getting to know their new teammates was a gradual process. Kim Yo Jong then met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and, on behalf of her brother, invited him to a summit. But past efforts failed to bring long-term stability to the Korean Peninsula, and the deepening of the North Korean nuclear crisis brought timid contacts to an abrupt end.
