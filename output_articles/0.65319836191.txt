The details tell the story of the Russian efforts to mess with U.S. democracy, from the creation of fake social media accounts to identity theft to on-the-ground research in the United States and to the purchase of social media advertising. They paid for a demonstrator “to wear a costume portraying Clinton in a prison uniform” and wired money to someone in the United States “to build a cage large enough to hold an actress portraying Clinton in a prison uniform. Was it Russian efforts to trash Clinton and help Trump with false information? Yet the president has long resisted every piece of evidence pointing in this direction, and as a result, he has done nothing about it. He has not answered a direct question about the findings, nor has he been asked what he thinks should be done about them. You would think Mr. Trump would take a moment to repudiate that support, even in hindsight, and to declare that no foreign power has a right to campaign secretly against an American candidate. Second, Mr. Mueller has not finished his investigation and has not ruled out the possibility of collusion. We don’t yet know whether Donald Trump Jr.’s eagerness to meet with Russians offering “dirt” on Ms. Clinton’s campaign was an isolated incident. Nor has the special counsel yet weighed in on the question of possible obstruction of his investigation by President Trump.  .
