Then, on a yearlong trip abroad with his wife, Bobbie, he peered into an art gallery in Vallauris, France, and was struck by the abstract welded sculptures in the window. Sculpture, he told his wife on the spot, was what he wanted to do. So he persuaded the gallery owner to teach him welding, and with his wife helping to make pottery in the gallery’s nearby studio, they were paid in meals. On his website, where he described his sculptures, he wrote, “Early daddy longleg encounters stick in our brain and remain so embedded that, as adults, we can time-travel the long, dusty road back to our childhood. Mr. Harvey’s wildlife models included a group of pigs at the New Bolton Center School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Kennett Square, where Ms. Harvey was a laboratory technician. One especially friendly sow routinely sat near Mr. Harvey and his portable sculpting table as if she were a paid model. Mr. Harvey produced limited editions of all his sculptures. One of his 25 “Helens” was stolen from the front of the Brandywine River Museum of Art in Chadds Ford, Pa. Mr. Harvey’s rural upbringing near a creek provided some inspiration for his art: A farmhouse on his family’s property had a cow and chickens, and he and his brother Rusty enjoyed playing with snakes. Years later, Rusty brought his pet raccoon to his brother’s studio as a model for a sculpture of a raccoon with a fish in its mouth.
