Chris McKenna, a 15-year-old freshman, was trying to get to the bathroom in the building when he encountered Mr. Cruz in the stairwell. Mr. Cruz was loading bullets into his rifle. Calls began streaming into 911. A description of the shooter went out over police radio: maroon shirt, black pants and a black hat, and carrying a black duffel bag and a black backpack. One of the last students to slip inside the classroom was Matthew Zeif, 14, just ahead of Mr. Beigel. Mr. Gilroy went outside and stood atop a berm in his backyard, peering at the school through trees and shrubs for any clues about what was happening. In incidents that began in 2012, when Mr. Cruz was 13, he was disciplined for being disobedient and unruly. A year before, it was discovered that Mr. Cruz had a Nazi symbol and a racial slur on his book bag. In the fall of 2001, Mr. Shears decamped to the East Village, where he was working as a go-go dancer, after returning from a backpacking trip in Europe to discover that one of his roommates had been subletting his bedroom to a couple from Brussels. Mr. Shears had long craved the spotlight, ever since his mother enrolled them in a tap class together when he was in fourth grade. Mr. Moukarbelâ€™s work was pulling him westward (he directed documentaries about Banksy and Lady Gaga), so they gave up their New York life and bought a Streamline Moderne-style house in Los Feliz for $1.
