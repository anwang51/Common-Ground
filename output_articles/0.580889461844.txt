The final stage of Lindsey Vonn's journey back to the Olympics wound past lonely farmhouses and ice-choked rivers along the narrow road up to the Jeongseon Alpine Centre. But Vonn's blitz down the glistening super-G course at the Pyeongchang Olympics on Saturday ended in disappointment. She finished tied for sixth and wondered what might have been if not for a time-killing mistake on a turn late in the race. And there's the heartbreak that includes a divorce in early 2013 and a relationship with Tiger Woods before they split up in 2015.. All the while, Vonn piled up victories on the World Cup circuit. A pair of downhill wins this month pushed her career total to 81. That's the most by any woman and short of only the 86 by Sweden's Ingemar Stenmark. Vonn started first Saturday, putting her in the difficult position of not getting feedback on the course conditions from other skiers and fighting a headwind. In the final stretch, she took a sharp left turn too wide and almost lost control. After skidding to a stop in front of the grandstand  supporters had a sign reading "She wins if she Vonns"  she shook her head, then mouthed: "I tried". The 26th skier to start, Ester Ledecka of the Czech Republic, is a snowboarding champion with only a handful of podium finishes in World Cup events.
