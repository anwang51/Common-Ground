Because Chen was so far back after the short program, the 18-year-old Salt Lake City native skated in the second group Saturday. "I did what I did in the short program and these guys skated well in the short and did pretty well in the long as well. Hanyu, 23, ranked second in the long program with 206.17 points, but the huge lead he had built after the short program held up. Chen raised his hands to his face. "Just happy that I did what I did, and kind of upset that I did what I did with such a bad short program and it won't balance out". The fact Chen won the free skate and failed to medal only underscored how terribly he skated in the short program Friday. The decision to attempt six quadruple jumps in the long program was made that night. The program started with a quadruple lutz, which was followed by a quadruple lutz and double toeloop combination. Chen was dominant for the remainder of the program, landing three more quadruple jumps. Even cooler will be to see how what Chen learned Saturday will appear on the ice in four years.
