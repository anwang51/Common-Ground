That scene remains haunting because it hints at both the agony and the scale of mass shootings. Children keep dying. And our country do anything about it.. The United States, to put it bluntly, has grown callous about the lives of its children. We mourn their deaths when they happen, of course. But an empty mourning, because it is not accompanied by any effort to prevent more suffering  including straightforward steps that every other affluent nation has taken.. Guns are a big part of the callousness, but only a part of it. They are one of three main reasons the United States has become the most dangerous of wealthy nations for a child to be born into, according to a study in Health Affairs. The other two are vehicle crashes and infant mortality.. The chart here, from that study, shows just how much of an outlier the United States has become. This country suffers almost 21,000 excess deaths each year. how many children and teenagers would be spared if the United States had an average mortality rate for a rich country.. another way to think about those 21,000: Imagine the Sandy Hook firehouse, filled with the devastated families of 20 children. Now add two other Sandy Hook firehouses, each with 20 more families receiving the worst possible news. Now imagine that scene repeating itself every day, year after year after year.. Other countries are simply trying harder to keep their children alive. They have studied major causes of death and then attacked them, in an evidenced-based way.. What would such an approach look like in this country?. All of which is a good reminder to get politically engaged. If the current crop of politicians willing to protect our children from harm, replace them with politicians  from either party  who are.
