Reuters Staff. 2 Min Read. DUBAI (Reuters) - Careem, a Middle East competitor to Uber Technologies [UBER.UL], said on Sunday it had acquired RoundMenu and would start trialing food delivery services through the restaurant listing and reservation online platform this month. . The Dubai-based ride hailing firm acquired the website and app for an undisclosed sum. . “Careem will begin testing a delivery capability for RoundMenu customers on a small scale later this month,” it said in a statement to Reuters. . RoundMenu has a presence in 18 cities across nine Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt, according to its website.  . There is demand for delivery services in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf Arab states where temperatures can soar above 50 degrees in the summer. . Several food delivery companies, including Talabat, Zomato, UberEats, and Deliveroo, are active in the region. . RoundMenu has raised $3.1 million in funding since it launched in 2012, the Careem statement said. . Careem said in June it would accelerate expansion plans after raising $500 million from investors, including German carmaker Daimler and Saudi Arabia’s Kingdom Holding. . In July, it took a minority stake in an Egyptian start-up that connects commuters with private buses in Cairo. . Reporting by Alexander CornwellEditing by Shri Navaratnam
