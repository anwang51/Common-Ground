finitely win on an episode of If not for what worth, then in a race out of the parking lot.. ARE YOU FOLLOWING FOX NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK YET?. There was no paperwork with it, but its new owners say they ran a check on its vehicle identification number and it was never stolen and has a clean Carfax report. Someone just left it there for who knows how long.. The Z06 is a particularly high performance version of the Corvette tuned with track use in mind. It features a 505 hp 7.0-liter V8 with a six-speed manual transmission and had a starting price of around $75,000 when new.. Aside from a couple of scratches that it picked up being transported to its current auto shop in Duluth, Ga., it looks brand new after getting cleaned up.. The caveat emptor for bidders is that being offered without a title, so getting one is up to you.. As of Thursday morning the bidding had reached $38,000, which is around the going rate for a 2009 Z06, but there too many, if any, with as few miles as this one.. (Do we have $154?!).
