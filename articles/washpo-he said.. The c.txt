just not working, he said.. The comments, a day after the Justice Department indicted 13 Russians for interference in the election that catapulted Donald Trump to the White House, follow months of efforts by the president to cast doubt on assertions of meddling. . They came as McMaster used a high-profile address at a global security conference to try to rally Western allies against common enemies, offering an olive branch to U.S. partners that have often felt battered and neglected in the age of Trump. . The United States, McMaster said, is committed to working with Europe to combat nuclear proliferation, choke off funds for terrorist groups and thwart Russian ambitions.. But the appeal to solidarity could not hide the deep fissures among Western allies, examples of which abounded Saturday. On the second day of a conference dedicated to averting conflict, speeches by European leaders reflected the myriad strains afflicting decades-old alliances, including mistrust between Europe and the United States, anxiety over looming exit from the European Union, and a growing chasm between the east and west.. The United States, Gabriel said, had for decades been protector and inspiration as it emerged from the rubble of the Second World War and embraced democracy, multilateralism, the rule of law and free trade.. But Trump, Gabriel implied, had thrown that all into doubt.. We are no longer sure whether we recognize our America, he Germans understand, Gabriel added, which signals to watch to understand the direction of the United States under Trump: Is it deeds? Is it words? Is it speech may have added to the Unlike the president, who frequently castigates NATO allies for not hitting the target of spending of GDP on defense, McMaster made no direct mention of the Instead of the competition with allies over trade that Trump often cites, McMaster emphasized the need for Western democracies to bind together in competition against autocratic adversaries.. U.S. authorities had been reluctant in the past to detail what they knew about the meddling because, he said, you want to divulge your intelligence capabilities. But now, he said, it was in the public domain  and the United States was determined to fight future subterfuge.. The United States will expose and act against those who use cyberspace, social media and other means to advance campaigns of disinformation, subversion and espionage, McMaster said. We are already improving our ability to defeat these pernicious surprised there are any Russian cyber experts available, based on how active they have been in undermining our democracies across the West, he In a separate appearance, Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats said the indictment represents the culmination of a gathering of a mass amount of facts that were used to support last intelligence assessment concluding Russia had meddled in the 2016 election to help Trump. . Coats said everything that had been learned since the assessment was issued in January 2017 had verified that assessment. . Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who spoke immediately before McMaster, declined to comment on the indictment. Until we see the facts, everything else is just blabber, he said.. I would hope that they would be responsible and, I would like to highlight, autonomous in their international affairs, Lavrov said of E.U. countries, reflecting Russian language that frequently paints the European Union as lackeys of Washington.. The call for more autonomy was echoed among Europeans, many of whom used their conference speeches to argue that continent could not afford to abandon its close alliance with the United States, it would need to do more to stand on its Citing uncertainty in its American alliance and a growing challenge from Russia and China, Gabriel said Europe must take on an expanded military role..  As the only vegetarian, we will have a difficult position in a world of carnivores, he said.. That stance was attacked minutes later by Polish Prime Morawiecki, who called out free-riders who live under pax Americana but pretend to be I would like to live under pax said. But this is not the case. If we want to be more self-reliant, we really have to cater to our own security in a much better Poland is one of just four E.U. countries to hit target. About of defense spending in the 28-member alliance comes from the United With the second-biggest spender in NATO, Britain, on track to leave the European Union, Prime Minister Theresa May sought to assure allies Saturday that her commitment to European security would remain But she then proceeded to warn her fellow European leaders that without a tailor-made deal to maintain British cooperation in areas such as extradition treaties and intelligence gathering, there would be damaging real-world The fissures extended southward as well, with Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim chastising the Syria policy of his largest NATO ally, the United States. Yildirim complained that Washington is working with Kurdish forces in Syria and Iraq that Ankara views as terrorists but that the United States sees as valuable allies in the fight against the Islamic State.. east-west tensions were also on display. Morawiecki batted down suggestions that Poland and other eastern European nations are straying from the liberal democratic traditions of western Europe, while chastising authorities in Brussels for not doing enough to secure external Sitting beside Morawiecki, Sebastian Kurz, the 31-year-old chancellor of Austria, echoed that Kurz, who was elected last year on an anti-immigration platform and has joined with a far-right party to form his government, said Europe needs to emphasize its Christian and Jewish The European Union, he said, had taken a wrong turn. Very often my feeling is that paralyzing The criticism added to the general mood of discord at the conference, which is held annually at one of swankiest hotels. But Wolfgang Ischinger, the former German ambassador who convenes the gathering, praised Kurz and Morawiecki for doing something that he said many E.U. and NATO allies refused to do: appear on stage That, he said, does not convey a good image.
