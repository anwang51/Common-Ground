The United States, McMaster said, is committed to working with Europe to combat nuclear proliferation, choke off funds for terrorist groups and thwart Russian ambitions..

U.S. authorities had been reluctant in the past to detail what they knew about the meddling because, he said, want to divulge your intelligence But now, he said, it was in the public domain and the U.S. was determined to fight future subterfuge.. United States will expose and act against those who use cyberspace, social media and other means to advance campaigns of disinformation, subversion and McMaster said. are already improving our ability to defeat these pernicious surprised there are any Russian cyber experts available, based on how active they have been in undermining our democracies across the he Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who spoke immediately before McMaster, declined to comment on the indictment. we see the facts, everything else is just he said.. would hope that they would be responsible and, I would like to highlight, autonomous in their international Lavrov said of E.U. countries, reflecting Russian language that frequently paints the European Union as lackeys of Washington.. The call for more autonomy was echoed among Europeans, many of whom used their conference speeches to argue that continent could not afford to abandon its close alliance with the United States, it would need to do more to stand on its Citing uncertainty in its American alliance and a growing challenge from Russia and China, Gabriel said Europe must take on an expanded military role..  the only vegetarian, we will have a difficult position in a world of he said..
