You know, one that as Merydith put it: high fetched and intended to intrigue the globe in order to get people to visit Down I laughed and smiled and sharpened my kitchen knives reading the entries that came in. They revealed, as usual, a deep vein of inquiry around what it means to be Australian and how to make that clear to the world.. Below are a few of my favorites pitches  both serious and playful  followed by our weekly roundup and a recommendation for a photo festival working with eager for quality entries.. ___. Tassie Time.  Sheila Allison. An Aussie Battler.  Mark Thomas. Croc Dundee, Feminists First.  Kirby Franklin Warnock. ______.

There are special categories for potraits, landscapes (like the winner above), mobile and for students too  and the great thing about it is that names and CVs are stripped off the entries. just the images that will make or break you so forget the networking, and start shooting!.
