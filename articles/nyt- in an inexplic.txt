THREE YEARS AGO in China, in an inexplicable trend that swept the country, tiny bean sprouts started rising from heads, their delicate, unsteady stems like green antennae, seemingly borne not from the dirt but from the mind. Little tulips, poppies and chrysanthemums soon followed. For a moment, it looked as if humans had suddenly been given the power to erupt into bloom. But the plants had no roots; they were made of plastic and affixed to hairpins. The fad quickly passed.. Indeed, long before makeup or millinery or jewelry, our first adornments were plants and flowers, and our love for them was  and is  universal. Perhaps we have never known better. But how and why we wear them has shifted over the years, from the laurel wreaths of the ancient world, bestowed on victors (and deemed so necessary to the functioning of a martial culture that Darius III of Persia, in the fourth century B.C., kept 46 men employed just to weave them), to the floral crowns donned by animists in medieval Europe to dance around maypoles and welcome spring.. In the past century, there was Frida Kahlo, her plaits threaded with blood-red dahlias; Billie Holiday, rarely onstage without gardenias sweeping down over her left ear, the blossoms nearly as large as gramophone horns; loose-limbed Joni Mitchell, in a daisy-chain crown, asking for peace, love and understanding; and the modern-day women that emulate her, in festivals from Glastonbury to Coachella.
