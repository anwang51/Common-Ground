This sounds awfully like the musings of Charleston, S.C., church shooter Dylann Roof or Norway’s Anders Breivik, who killed 69 people at a summer camp. Where does a political motive diverge from a delusion? Only in the case of Muslim killers are we confident that we can draw a bright line.. Perhaps most important — and chilling — what links mass shootings is the sense of sheer randomness they invoke. Even when the perpetrators know their victims, as in the shootings in San Bernardino and Fort Hood, Tex., they rarely stop to target foes or spare friends. The mere act of being present makes one a legitimate target. It is this feature of contemporary terrorism — whether in Paris or Parkland — that unites disparate acts of violence and constitutes their prime psychological menace: It could be anyone, anywhere. No guilt is required; your best efforts may not save you. Mass shootings thus represent the total breakdown of correlation between human agency and one’s fate. Survival seems to be a game of pure chance, and it is precisely this horrible truth that makes us quiver.
