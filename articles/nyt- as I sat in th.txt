I remember being certain, as I sat in theaters watching “Circle of Friends” and “Good Will Hunting,” that Minnie Driver and I would really like each other. This was back in the mid-1990s, and we were both just breaking through in our careers — she, admittedly, a bit more fabulously as an Academy Award nominee, while I was writing newspaper articles.. I realize that pretty much everyone who watched these movies thought Minnie could be their best friend, and that was kind of the point of her string of relatable, lovable, new twist on the girl-next-door roles. But she and I were practically twins! Born the same year, we had similar brown curly hair and identical senses of humor (alas, I lack the adorable British accent).. The event is part of a new push to to use live events around the world to showcase our journalism and start provocative conversations.. With these events, The Times is bringing our brand of journalism alive for readers, in real life and, often, via video-stream.. For people outside the United States, who might be less familiar with The Times, we think these events can be a crucial and compelling introduction. We want to remind them that we are on the ground reporting in their neighborhoods (for example, we now have more than 40 journalists in our London newsroom!). We want to show them how our journalism is distinct from our competitors.. “There is no moral ground that you take these days that doesn’t have a” consequence, she told me Wednesday in a telephone conversation.. She likened the #MeToo movement to an ”insurgency” and compared it to political rebellions where public scrutiny quickly trained on the rebels.. “As with most insurgents, you stop looking at that which is being rebelled against,” she said, citing the Syrian civil war, which started with street protests against President Bashar al-Assad and is now in its seventh brutal year. "You stop looking at Assad and you start looking at ISIS.”
