WARNING: This post contains spoilers and discusses characters in Black Panther. I will feed you a nice Ghanaian jollof meal if you read further anyway.. So as a Kenyan, what did you think about the movie? How did you feel about Wakanda?. A lot of people here supported Black Lives Matter and think police should be shooting black people in the U.S., but they are perfectly okay with the Kenyan or Zimbabwean police cracking down on protesters violently. You speak out against an injustice half a world away, but when injustice right on your doorstep, okay with it because of the party or endorse..
