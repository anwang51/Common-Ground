Gill said he wanted to sing "Forever Changed" at Tuesday night's Country Music Hall of Fame benefit in New York City to honor "the spirit of what's going on these days.". "You put your hands where they don't belong and now her innocence is dead and gone," Gill sang. "God was watching and he knows your name/Because of you, forever changed.". Fellow singer Emmylou Harris, who was among the three female artists who joined Gill at the event, praised the 60-year-old for his powerful song.. "Strong stuff man, good for you," Harris told Gill. "I do think that music can change people's hearts and minds with lyrics like that.
