Officials said that they hoped that the theater — a flexible performance space with three combinable halls that will be called the Perelman Center in recognition of a $75 million gift from the billionaire businessman Ronald O. Perelman — could open as soon as the 2020-21 season, and that they plan to produce multidisciplinary works there with many partners.. “I think the vision is going to flow organically out of the space, and what the World Trade Center means to the city of New York, and what it means to the country, and what it means to the world,” Mr. Rauch said in a telephone interview. He added: “The work of the Perelman is going to be about blurring boundaries between disciplines, blurring boundaries between communities.”. Mr. Rauch said that while he would start working on plans for the Perelman Center now, he would remain with the Shakespeare festival through the summer of 2019, when he will move to New York.. But Mr. Perelman’s $75 million donation in 2016 got the project back on track.. While he did not tip his hand too much about what he envisioned for the site, he did say that he hoped to create thematic programming — inviting, say, a dance company from another part of the world to create a piece there while commissioning a new play by a playwright with roots in the same area and inviting immigrants from around the city to see it. “I think our job as an arts organization,” he said, “is to bring hope by bringing people together.”
