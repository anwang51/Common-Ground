The duties of a magistrate vary widely, and people would often come to me with difficult situations, such as domestic violence victims seeking protective orders. I did my best to encourage people to see their self-worth, find hope and locate resources to help them. This was something I enjoyed greatly. But my favorite role as a magistrate was officiating civil wedding ceremonies. Presiding over two people committing their lives to each other filled me with so much joy that I routinely stepped in for other magistrates who didn’t like performing that task.. But the state government rejected this solution and made clear that I had to choose between my faith and my job. I was told that if I did not perform same-sex weddings, I would be subject to civil penalties and criminal prosecution. Facing this choice, I was forced to resign in 2014. I lost the job that I loved, one I’d held for five years, and my retirement that would have vested in just two months.. As one of the most diverse countries in the world, it’s no surprise that we disagree on sex, religion and many other things. The great thing is, our civil rights laws point us to a society where we can live, work and break bread together despite our differences. My case shows that we can find reasonable solutions that protect the freedom and dignity of everyone.
