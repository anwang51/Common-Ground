The enthusiasm around just about finally getting to see a mostly black action blockbuster, a milestone we should have been celebrating decades ago. about being able to go to the movies without feeling like the future of black film is at stake.. Black progress in Hollywood has been slow. As long as black actors and actresses are routinely typecast and black filmmakers struggle for opportunities to go beyond the same few genres, black moviegoers will feel pressure to support any and every black production that manages to break the mold. We hold our breath hoping that box office results are strong and if not, we wonder whether another black movie will get a chance. whose record-breaking ticket pre-sales all but ensured that it will be a success, is an exception. We have to root for it to win. We can just watch the movie.. Complex action heroes? Not so much.. turned out to be an overpriced dumpster fire of non-biodegradable trash that failed miserably at the box office, and again, black audiences wondered if get another shot.. a big-budget action movie and the first major comic genre film to feature a black director, screenwriter and cast, could also open the door to more black blockbusters and more genres. But with its success all but assured, black filmgoers can simply watch and enjoy, without worrying that the box office receipts could break the futures of other black film projects. be watching a black movie that rely on caricatures and recycled tropes, and rest easy knowing that it bomb and may prove to Hollywood the extent of our potential (as if more proof was necessary).. Maybe the question black audiences will ask now we get another but will we do
