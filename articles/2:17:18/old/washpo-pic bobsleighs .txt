First, some context: Olympic bobsleighs cost a lot of money tens of thousands of dollars. And teams spend so much time tinkering with their sleighs to make them faster that they sometimes bring multiple sleighs to competition, in case one performs better than another on a given track.. And because teams bring multiple sleighs, if something should happen to yours and you have a backup, to find another one, let alone one fast.. All of that makes what happened to bobsled team a harrowing tale.. Kiriasis suddenly quit during these Olympic Games in PyeongChang, South Korea (which is very far Jamaica), she insisted she had the rights to the sleigh.. Jamaica rented a sleigh for the Games from a club in Winterberg, Germany, team spokesperson Kathleen Pulito told The Washington Post. signed the lease and thus claimed the sleigh when she left the team.. Jamaica contention was moot since she rented the sleigh on behalf of was working as an agent of Pulito still left the team without a bobsled, even if it was technically right.. Enter Red Stripe, the Jamaican brewing company. It offered to put the cost of a new sleigh whatever the cost may be.. The catch? It actually a new sleigh. Jamaica just bought the sleigh outright.. All that is great, but it might not do much to help the Jamaican team, which has some sledding ahead in the actual medalists Elana Meyers Taylor (silver) and Jamie Greubel Poser (bronze), both of the U.S., are the likely Kaillie Humphries is seeking her third straight gold medal..
