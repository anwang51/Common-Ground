The Weinstein Company’s board of directors announced Friday night that they had unanimously voted to fire the company’s president and chief operating officer, David Glasser, for cause.. The one-sentence statement did not specify what the cause was. Still, the move represents yet another twist in an ongoing saga that has engulfed the embattled company.. The company had been nearing a deal to sell itself to an investor group, but it hit a last-minute snag this week when Eric T. Schneiderman, New York’s attorney general, filed a lawsuit against the studio and its founders alleging that they repeatedly violated laws barring gender discrimination, sexual harassment and other offenses.. Mr. Schneiderman’s lawsuit does not name Mr. Glasser, but it refers to him by his title and says that the sale of the company could result in employees reporting to some of the same managers “who failed to investigate” Mr. Weinstein’s conduct or protect female employees from him.. Efforts to contact Mr. Glasser early Saturday morning were unsuccessful.. “We are going to be O.K.,” two people who attended the meeting recalled Mr. Glasser saying. He said his door was open to anyone who wanted to talk.. At the time, Bob Weinstein — who led the effort to retain Mr. Glasser — attributed Mr. Glasser’s change of heart in part to a personal friendship between Mr. Glasser and the brothers.. “Harvey and I sometimes don’t even want to be brothers,” Bob Weinstein said at the time. “I don’t know why anyone would want to be another brother.”. But Mr. Glasser, ”should he want it,” Bob Weinstein said, “has become the third brother.”
