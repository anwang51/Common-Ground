National forests and other public lands will waive fees Monday in honor of Presidents Day. But it's not your only chance to visit for free this year.. On Monday, you also can visit public lands operated by the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Reclamation for free.. But don't expect national parks to follow suit.. Last year, visitors saved admission on Presidents Day at places such as Joshua Tree, Death Valley and Yosemite national parks, which charge $25 to $30 per vehicle.. This year, national parks will offer free admission only on April 21, the first day of National Park Week; Sept. 22, National Public Lands Day; and Nov. 11, Veterans Day. National parks also waived fees on Martin Luther King Jr. Day in January.. travel@latimes.com. @latimestravel
