President Trump is a force of nature. Actually, he is a full-blown meteorological phenomenon.. Trump in an adulterous affair? With a porn star? And hush money? You couldn’t invent a scandal better than this.. Whatevs.. But here’s the odd thing: Any one of these weather systems should, by ordinary standards, capsize a high official. So why don’t they merge into a perfect storm of scandal for Trump?. But even as the bigger storm absorbs the smaller storm, Samenow explains, the dissipating storm disrupts the stronger storm’s structure and circulation, creating wind shear and limiting the development of thunderstorms.. The merged storms, in short, are less than the sum of their parts.. The proliferation and intermingling of Trump scandals, likewise, reduce the impact that any one of them would have by itself.. Hurricane Daniels might be a major storm, but when it begins to dance the Fujiwhara with Hurricane Mueller (a slow-moving Cat 5), Hurricane Porter (Cat 3) and Tropical Storms Kushner, Pruitt and Shulkin, the system becomes highly disorganized and loses strength.. Trump is saved by scandal overkill.. Sorry, Stormy, you’ve been downgraded. .  .  .  .  .  .
