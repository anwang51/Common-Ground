The fiery crash occurred shortly before 1 p.m. near Riverside Avenue. It involved the concrete truck, which had been traveling west, a smaller truck and four cars.. California Highway Patrol Officer Bryan Alvarez said five people suffered fatal injuries and another was taken to the hospital in unknown condition.. The freeway was closed in both directions as CHP investigators examined the scene and rescuers tried to extract the injured. The CHP asked commuters to use the 215 and 15 freeways and to avoid the stretch of the 10 near Rialto for several hours.. At 5 p.m., two westbound lanes reopened, the CHP said. The eastbound side remained closed until about 2 a.m., when the Riverside Avenue onramp to the eastbound lanes opened and all eastbound lanes were open from that point.. All eastbound lanes remained closed from Riverside back to Cedar Avenue.. As of 3 a.m., just two westbound lanes were open.. It was unclear when more lanes would open.. richard.winton@latimes.com.
