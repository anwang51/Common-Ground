The ultimate guide to. Where to find the best restaurants, bars, spas, shopping and more.. Can’t get to Pyeongchang? Los Angeles may not have snow, but we have Koreatown, a vibrant neighborhood of incredible restaurants, bars, markets, spas, bookstores and more. Exploring it is a sport all its own.. If you have been watching the Pyeongchang Olympics, hoping to catch a glimpse of the area’s famous buckwheat noodles, or wish that the coverage reached to the local trout farms as well as the biathlon and the luge, you aren’t alone. Korea is one of the most fascinating food countries in the world, with regional dishes that seem to change from block to block, a mind-wrenching array of fermentations, and spicy foods hardwired to jolt the pleasure center of your brain.. Los Angeles, of course, is lucky enough to have the largest Korean community outside the motherland and a concentration of restaurants that pick up trends sometimes just months after they have hit Seoul. Koreatown isn’t just a Korean neighborhood — with its markets, nightclubs, towers, billiard parlors and food-obsessive mini-malls, it sometimes seems as if it is a distant prefecture of Seoul that just happens to be extra-rich in Salvadorans and Oaxacans; a place that honors not just the emigrés who started arriving in California in the late 1970s but also their children — Chloe Kim! — who have invented a brand new way to be American..

Because it always put a little jump in my step, imagining that the set menu of eight seasoned pork belly slabs was toning my body in eight different ways, the ginseng pork belly toning metabolism before the garlic pork belly got around to the cholesterol, the curry-flavored pork belly preventing Alzheimer’s before the bright-green herbed pork belly went to work easing depression. It’s like statins, beta-blockers and Prozac all in one, administered in the form of tabletop-grilled pork belly. Could you ask for more persuasive evidence of a loving God?. (213) 365-1750.

And the brine-steam-fry recipe in David Chang’s Momofuku cookbook turns out to be pretty easy to make. But while the heat may have come down a bit on KyoChon since it was the white-hot center of the fried chicken universe, the shattering, thin-skinned snap of its basic, garlic-saturated bird is still worth keeping in mind. And it comes with all the marinated turnip cubes you can eat.. (213) 739-9292. (213) 739-9292. (213) 487-6008. (213) 487-6008. (323) 795-0014. (323) 795-0014. (213) 388-3314. (213) 388-3314.

Even in its earliest days there were always places that were fancier or used better cuts of meat. But Soot Bull Jeep, which is still the only restaurant in Koreatown to rely solely on live coals, has always been a lot of people’s favorite KBBQ — not just soju and platters of marinated raw meat, but smoke, fire and showers of small cinders that can leave your shirt looking like one of the Three Stooges after an encounter with an exploding cigar. . (213) 387-3865. (213) 387-3865. Korean barbecue, yes. But more to the point, Korean duck barbecue: sliced duck breast cooked on heavy iron grills in a room thick with the miasma of vaporized fat. You snatch the slices from the grill as they cook and incorporate them into a kind of endless duck salad. The non-breast parts of the duck cook slowly, rendering into cracklings if you can bear to wait that long. And the best part, as always, is the fried rice at the end made with the collected duck fat and scraps of kimchi from the table; sweet and spicy and crisp.. (323) 634-9292. (323) 634-9292.

Located on the bottom floor of a shopping center, Go Pocha is sandwiched between a smoke shop and a clothing store, and you will probably think you’re in the wrong place. Inside, the dining room sparkles with twinkling lights wrapped around a tree in the center of the room. Hundreds of what seem to be real $100 bills are stapled to the trunk and along the branches. (You’ll invariably inspect one closely before the night is through.) The dining room looks like the bottom of a game of Tetris, with semi-private tables sectioned off so that your rowdy party feels like the most important one in the room. Each table receives a free skillet of scrambled eggs, cooked at the table — their version of a complimentary bread and butter service. Order a bottle of fizzy soju (called sparkling soju) and you’ll get a shimmy or two from the waiter as he swirls the bottle and pours everyone a shot. Soju, cheese corn, kimchi pancake, an inspection of the $100 bills: Repeat until those twinkling lights start to fade.. (213) 381-0088. (213) 381-0088. (323) 465-6803. (323) 465-6803. (213) 985-3823.

And it’s just as good a place as any to pick up a microphone and belt out your version of “Bette Davis Eyes.” It’s easy to reserve a room if you call ahead, and they have a decent selection in the songbooks. Most of the rooms have disco lights or some sort of lighting that will make you feel like you’re in a ’70s dance club. The smallest bottle of soju easily serves three; let this be a little insight into the type of evening you’ll have. And there are plenty of snacks to munch on while you sing: spicy chicken wings; spicy seafood soup and kimchi fried rice. They charge for the rooms by the hour, so plan accordingly.. (213) 380-0909.

The bowl of complimentary, stale, cracked tortillas chips delivered to your table when you arrive can be a godsend — but likely only at the end of the evening. The menus are a tad sticky, and as you look up to admire one of the many hanging lanterns, you realize the decor in here once again reminds you of a pirate ship, with both tables and chairs made out of wide, misshapen wooden planks. But you are here for perhaps the last round of soju of the night. The bar serves Chamisul as well as Chum Churum soju (which is a little harsher going down), and a selection of flavored soju (unless you like bad-flavored vodka, probably skip these). Crazy fries anyone? Whatever you’re imagining, this is crazier: a heap of fries peering up from a blanket of cheese sauce that tastes like mayonnaise mixed with honey mustard but that the server insists is actually cheese sauce, and a sprinkling of crushed Flamin’ Hot Cheetos..

Located on the bottom floor of a shopping center, the inside of Choice Meat Market is a meat lover’s paradise, the small space defined by a sprawling meat counter filled with a wide range of cuts at competitive prices. Whether you’re looking for beef shabu-shabu, thinly-sliced rib-eye or pork collar bulgogi, the market carries a great selection of kobe-style, prime and choice meat, primarily beef and pork, including pre-marinated options. Choice Meats, which has been open for 24 years, also makes gift sets if you’re looking for that something special for you or the meat lover in your life. The market also carries a limited selection of banchan.. (213) 235-9560. (213) 235-9560. Perhaps the best sesame oil (cham gileum) you’ll find in Los Angeles comes from an unassuming little storefront hidden in that awkward triangular intersection on 8th Street, between Oxford and Western Avenues. There is no English sign out front, but you might know you’ve arrived if you catch a whiff of fresh sesame oil coming out of the front door. Mr. Chong (he doesn’t like to share his first name and refuses any sort of publicity), presses the oil himself in the back of the store and offers two varieties: a nutty, caramel brown toasted sesame oil and a slightly darker toasted black sesame oil. According to Chong, the regular sesame oil is the most popular with customers. Chong also offers freshly-pressed perilla oil and a small selection of bulk seeds, grains, nuts and spices. The store accepts cash only.. (213) 387-0651. (213) 387-0651. Opened in the basement of a sprawling upscale shopping center in 2014, the Los Angeles H-Mart is one of a national chain of Korean-focused supermarkets, which first opened on the East Coast in 1987. H Mart is a one-stop shop for all your grocery needs. The supermarket has a massive produce section which includes a wide array of herbs, roots and Asian fruit and produce. There are extensive selections of meat, poultry and seafood, as well as packaged and frozen foods. And you’ll also find aisles of spices, oils and sauces, dry goods, snacks and a variety of goods, Korean and otherwise. And don’t forget to stock up on kitchen supplies: The store carries a vast assortment of inexpensive cooking equipment and kitchen tools.. (213) 382-9444. (213) 382-9444. Perhaps you’ve seen the jars of Kae Sung kimchi sold in local stores and supermarkets. The brand may be the most popular kimchi in Los Angeles. The dish, a staple of Korean cuisine, is made by fermenting a variety of seasonal vegetables including cabbage, cucumbers and radishes. Sook Jae Cho, the matriarch of Kae Sung, has been making kimchi for almost five decades. For years, you could find her and her family at the market, selling a variety of kimchi flavors at a fraction of the price you might find elsewhere , touting the fresh, crisp flavors made without any MSG or artificial ingredients. Kae Sung Market is still open, though it recently changed hands and is now owned by Gui Yong Yang. Yang promises to keep the recipes — and all those funky, delicious flavors — the same..

In the same strip mall as bossam specialist Kobawoo House is the nominally industrial Alchemist Coffee Project. Its location will be familiar to you if you’ve followed the specialty coffee scene over the last few years: Before it transitioned to Alchemist in 2016, the shop was called Bourbon Street Cafe. If you liked Bourbon Street’s take on New Orleans-style coffee, with cold brew, milk and a touch of chicory, you’ll be happy to know that you can still find it here on Alchemist’s menu. In addition, the crew makes terrific pour-over coffee and espresso drinks with beans from roasters such as Heart Coffee Roasters from Portland, Ore., and 49th Parallel Coffee Roasters from Vancouver, Canada. The shop has plenty of seats, though it does tend to get busy: Southwestern Law School is right around the corner, so it’s just as likely you’ll be sitting next to someone reading Paulo Coelho as someone studying for their torts final.. (213) 388-8767. (213) 388-8767. @alchemistcp. San Ji's Balcony Coffee and Tea is located in a strip mall on the northern edge of Koreatown, a cozy, homey place that has been supplying this part of the neighborhood with coffee for almost two years. When you walk in, you’ll find various figurines (Astro Boy, Spider-Man) posed around the shop, plus the Korean edition of the “Hunger Games” trilogy on the shelves alongside a rather impressive collection of John Grisham’s greatest hits. There’s also an old issue of GQ with Brad Pitt on the cover; not uncoincidentally, the most popular drink here is called the Brad Pitt, a sweetened iced latte topped with a cloud of soft, lovely foam. It’s made, as all drinks are here, with coffee from Stumptown Coffee Roasters. There’s a lovely patio too, lush and serene with greenery. If you’d rather something other than the Brad Pitt for your moment of peace, the cortados, matcha lattes and other drinks on the menu are solid options as well.. (213) 309-8414. (213) 309-8414. @balcony_coffeeteam. Beau Bar probably is one of the most Instagrammable coffee spots in Koreatown since it began pulling espressos off its La Marzocco early last year, a place where it’s not uncommon to catch someone taking a selfie with her Corgi outside and where the most coveted seat for both photographing and sitting is the wicker chair hanging from the ceiling toward the back of the shop. Photo shoots aside, you can well imagine taking Philip Pullman’s latest and enjoying it here with a cappuccino, honey latte or any other of Beau Bar's coffee drinks, made with the shop's own roasted beans. There is also a house horchata; a thick, mixed-grain milkshake made with misugaru; smoothies; and sparkling iced fruit concoctions. Like so much of the neighborhood, Beau Bar is open late — until 11 p.m. every day, meaning you can drop in for a coffee (and a photo) before finishing the night at Dan Sung Sa across the street.. (213) 382-8482. (213) 382-8482. beaubarcoffeeandtea.com. Lavender and rose lattes are popular throughout Koreatown, but there are few places that combine those floral flavors with coffee and tea as well as Bia Coffee. Which isn’t a surprise given who’s behind the bar: Silbia Lee was once a florist in Korea and worked in various coffee shops in the United States before partnering with Moses Choi to open Bia Coffee last year. The flower syrups — all all-natural — are used judiciously; thus even if you think you wouldn’t be partial to lattes or teas perfumed with rose, lavender or vanilla, you might be pleasantly surprised by the ones here. These also happen to make for pretty pictures, but don’t let that distract you from actually enjoying your latte (lest you forget, a sign reminds you to stir your iced drink after photographing it). Should you nonetheless prefer your drink sans flowers, there are coffees, teas and sodas offered without. The coffee is locally roasted by Klatch Coffee.. (213) 568-3007. (213) 568-3007. @biacoffee_la. Artists Sojung Kwon and Byoungok Koh opened Document Coffee Bar in 2014, turning a space that once housed an art gallery into one of the best coffee shops in the city. Certainly, it’s one of the most unique: A file folder serves as the shop’s logo, 5-gallon buckets double as light fixtures, and you’ll be sitting in the sort of chairs you probably haven’t sat in since elementary school. As for the coffee, the shop stocks beans from roasters you often don’t see elsewhere — recently, for instance, beans from Oakland-based AKA Coffee and Arkansas roaster Onyx Coffee Lab were on the shelves — and the baristas consistently make excellent espresso drinks, including macchiatos, Gibraltars and flat whites. If you’re a fan of cold brew, you will probably very much like the Document Cold, the shop’s cold brew mixed with a bit of chicory and maple syrup. Should you prefer tea instead, your choices include mulberry leaf and other Korean teas. After you’re done working or studying here, stick around: Document often hosts events like art exhibits and poetry readings. And latte art contests too. Of course.. (310) 465-8135.
