Your board could adopt a house rule, limiting the size and weight of patio furniture, or requiring residents to anchor large objects to the floor, Mr. Sherman said. It could even impose fines for those who don’t comply. Such new rules would likely require a simple majority vote of board members.. Write a letter to the board and the managing agent, explaining the events that transpired and expressing your concerns that the board has not taken steps to prevent another incident. Ask the neighbor whose railing was damaged to sign the letter, too. You could also report the condition to 311, or 911, if it’s an emergency.. Another option: Figure out whose furniture went flying and contact the neighbor, ideally in person. “Take it up directly with the neighbor,” Ms. Weisberg said, and maybe ask, “Why are you not doing something to secure it?”
