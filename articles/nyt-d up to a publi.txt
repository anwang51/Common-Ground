Those distinctions may add up to a public relations victory for the blockbuster factory responsible for The Avengers and the rest of the $13 billion Marvel Cinematic Universe, but a mixed one  to count the racial milestones is to acknowledge the homogeneity of its predecessors. (There have been 17, since counting.). Black Panther is also, of course, a shrewd bet on the social and economic muscle of black filmgoers. Mr. film, based on an unsung 1960s creation of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, has inspired a level of anticipation that wildly exceeds the name recognition of its title character  owing, in part, to pent-up demand for a megabudget movie devoted to black life.. Taking part in the discussion were Mr. Coogler; Chadwick Boseman, who plays a.k.a. Black Panther, king of the fictional African nation of Wakanda; Lupita (Nakia, a Wakandan spy and love interest); Michael B. Jordan (Erik Killmonger, an African-American adversary of Black Danai Gurira (Okoye, greatest warrior); and Kevin Feige, a producer of Black Panther and president of Marvel Studios. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.. I read a funny tweet the other day that said this movie is basically reparations.. [Rolling laughter]. Kevin, long been this idea in Hollywood that movies with black casts perform well internationally. Does that end with Black For the actors, what did joining this film mean to you and how did it feel different from other movies done?. On set, did you have that feeling of This is important or did you just try to do good work like normal? . If I get to set and a hundred black people on the side of a waterfall and Lupita is dressed in this adornment and Danai is dressed in this adornment and like, Hey Ryan, do I stand here or here? I think, Ah, this is amazing, making Black Panther and all these black folks on screen! I really gotta tell Danai that she needs to move over here, and I gotta tell her five reasons why gotta move over here, because gonna wanna know em! [Laughter]. But seriously, I grew up reading these comic books and watching all these movies. If I really thought about the fact that making one of these things right now, with people I know and love, I would break down emotionally. I be no good to anybody.. In that moment, I was like, This is big. I had never been on a set with so many black people before and we were all so focused and I could feel a vibration in the air. We all felt so privileged to have an opportunity to be a part of this moment in history.. Michael, one of the interesting complexities of the film comes from identity as an African-American, which contrasts against African-ness. What did you want to bring to the character?. But the truth is that some of those places that people might refer to as backwaters  and these recent comments definitely the first time somebody has said something like that  were the cradle of civilization. They were the first places to do anything that we would consider to be civilized.. All the structures that we built in Wakanda, taller structures of what find in Africa. Some of them we switched up  instead of mud we used [the fictional supermetal] vibranium  but those are buildings that really find in Mali, in Ethiopia, in Nigeria.. I spent about three weeks in Africa [doing research for Black and I truly felt that seeing it for myself was necessary for my growth as a human being. That experience made me not only capable [of writing] this film, but it made me whole as a person.
