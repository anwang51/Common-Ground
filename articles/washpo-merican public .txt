 .  .  . Every day, the American public hears new stories of sexual assault and other forms of violence against women, some detailing decades of threats and abuse. How many more women must come forward before this country gets serious about this problem?. I wanted to empower women to stand up for themselves no matter where they lived. Congress needed to open the elite federal courts and give women the control they deserved to get their truth heard. When police and prosecutors fell down on the job, a woman and her lawyer could step in; she could sue in federal as well as state court for damages for her injuries or to vindicate her name. Attorneys had incentives to bring such cases, because if the woman won, they could recover the costs of their time and the suit.. But Congress can redraft the law to fix that. If Congress can regulate cars and stock certificates even when they cross state lines, if it can regulate local workplace conditions, surely it can regulate something that deprives women of education and jobs across the nation.. We know from the first six years it existed that the civil rights remedy helped fill those gaps, mostly in cases of physical assault. Survivors in offices or on college campuses could bypass hostile prosecutors, disbelieving juries or angry employers. But because the Supreme Court struck it down, we will never know its full potential. . While there is no one solution to the problem of sexual assault, the Violence Against Women civil rights remedy can offer survivors a way to take back at least some of what they have lost. They deserve more  but certainly no less.. Congress should return to the federal civil rights remedy, improve and expand it if necessary, and fill the gaps the court found fatal last time around..
